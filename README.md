# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

## Results
There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt)
### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification (3 pt)
